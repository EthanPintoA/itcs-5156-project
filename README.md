# Project Setup

- Install the dependencies imported at the top of `main.ipynb`

  - Commonly used Machine Learning dependencies accessible through pip.

  - **Note:** There may be other dependencies not listed at the top.

- Download images/datasets from:

  - [Animal Image Dataset (90 Different Animals)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals/data)

    - Move images into workspace so that `animals/cat/0b54dde5f5.jpg` is accessible from the current/workspace folder.

  - [Animals-10](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10)

    - Move images into workspace so that `raw-img/cane/OIF-e2bexWrojgtQnAPPcUfOWQ.jpeg` is accessible from the current/workspace folder.

- **OPTIONAL:** Have a CUDA supported GPU greatly improves speed.
